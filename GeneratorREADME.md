## Takeaways
This activity was very informative. The main focus of this assignment was to learn how to use Node.js. After completing this assignment, I feel confident in my skills in regards to Node and will likely continue to use it throughout the rest of my coding career. I also gained a better understanding of how to utilize multiple js files at the same time.
